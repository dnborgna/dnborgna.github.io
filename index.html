        <td> <p class="fonts">Welcome to my tiny piece of the web! I&rsquo;m Denise, a student,  wife, and mother of one highly energetic (and too intelligent for his own good)  child. I am currently working on a degree in Network Management at Wake Tech when I am not busy chasing after my son. You may be saying, what free time would I have for hobbies? Travel? I do not have much free time with a busy soon-to-be 1st grader and classes, but it does not stop me from trying. </p>
<p class="fonts">So, what do I like to do…? I love exploring new places here in North Carolina (which I started calling home in 2005) or outside of the state. I love most sports and going to games when I can. Sports are big in my family &amp; it has been so much fun teaching my son about different sports and taking him to games. I have other hobbies, such as playing darts and gaming,  but these are more affected by time than others. It has been interesting trying to get my son into gaming (part of it is the games he can play due to his age,  and well, my favorite series is Resident Evil), but he tries. </p>
<p class="fonts">Now that you know a little bit about me, let&rsquo;s dive into some of the things I enjoy doing and places I have been able to explore. I hope you enjoy it!</p></td>
