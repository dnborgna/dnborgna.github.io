      <td><p class="fonts">As we grow up and learn more about everything around us, we find lots of   things to do to pass the time. I always enjoyed anything to do with   sports. I played softball and basketball growing up and even tried   hockey (even though I could not skate). As I got older, I got more into   going to sporting events with friends. Now, as my son is getting older   and able to understand things, he has a huge interest in sports. He   loves going to Mudcats &amp; Hornets games when we get to go.</p>
      <p class="fonts">Another thing I love is playing darts. I started playing darts back in   Brooklyn years ago &amp; continued to play when I moved to North   Carolina. It is a great way to meet people and be competitive in an   easy-going sport. </p>
      <p class="fonts">Another hobby of mine is gaming. I love video games, board games, you   name it! Sadly, life has put a lot of my gaming on the back burner but I   will play kid-friendly video games with my son, like Animal Crossing.   He loves it &amp; the game is super easy for him to process.</p>
